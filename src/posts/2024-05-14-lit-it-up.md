This is second part of my talk in September 2023 about the [Lit Framework](https://lit.dev). In my first talk ([Lit There Be Light](https://ilya.gorenburg.com/2023/09/12/lit-there-be-light)), I talked about the framework, its features, and areas where it can be used. In the new talk (Lit it up), I will share what weâ€™ve learned using this framework in production for eight months, its pros, key takeaways, and things to consider.
