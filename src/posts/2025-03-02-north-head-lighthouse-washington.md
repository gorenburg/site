Perched on a dramatic 130-foot cliff along the rugged coastline, the North Head Lighthouse has been guiding ships since 1897. Constructed after complaints from mariners about the Cape Disappointment Lighthouse being obscured by the headland, North Head was strategically built to provide a clear beacon for ships approaching from the north. Designed by Carl Leick, the 65-foot tower stands as a striking sentinel against the Pacific Ocean, its light visible for miles.

The site includes several historic buildings, such as oil houses, a keeper's residence, duplex quarters for assistant keepers, and a barnâ€”many of which remain intact, adding to the charm of this coastal landmark.

Initially, the first-order lens from the Cape Disappointment Lighthouse was moved to North Head and lit for the first time in 1898. Over the years, the lighthouse underwent several updates. In 1935, the original first-order lens was replaced by a fourth-order lens, which was eventually swapped for an aerobeacon in the 1950s. By 1961, a Crous-Hinds aero marine beacon was installed, and the lighthouse was fully automated by the end of that year. In 1999, the light was updated once more with the installation of a VRB-25 aerobeacon.

Today, the original first-order lens can be seen at the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center at Cape Disappointment State Park, while the fourth-order lens is on display at the Columbia River Maritime Museum in Astoria, Oregon.

In 2012, the U.S. Coast Guard transferred ownership of the lighthouse to Washington State Parks. Since then, efforts to repair and preserve the site have been led by the state and the Keepers of the North Head Lighthouse, a non-profit group working to ensure that this historic landmark continues to shine for future generations.

Whether you're a history buff, a maritime enthusiast, or just looking for a scenic adventure, a visit to North Head Lighthouse offers a fascinating glimpse into the past and breathtaking views of the Pacific Coast.
