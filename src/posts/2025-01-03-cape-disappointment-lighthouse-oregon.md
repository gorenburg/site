In 1848, it was recommended that a lighthouse be constructed at Cape Disappointment, located in what was then the Oregon Territory. An appropriation of $53,000 was approved in 1852, and after the lighthouse design was finalized, a first-order Fresnel lens was ordered. However, upon arrival, the lens was found to be too large for the tower, necessitating a two-year rebuilding of the structure. The first lighthouse in the Pacific Northwest was finally lit on October 15, 1856. Along with the light, the station was equipped with a 1,600-pound (730 kg) fog bell, operated by a striking mechanism. The keeper's residence was situated about a quarter of a mile away from the tower.

Despite its importance, the lighthouse had several issues. The fog bell, which was meant to warn ships in low visibility, was often inaudible due to the loud crashing of ocean waves. In 1881, the bell was discontinued and moved to West Point Light in Seattle, later being transferred again to Warrior Rock Light near Portland. Additionally, the lighthouse’s light was not visible to ships approaching from the north, a problem that was addressed by constructing a second lighthouse at North Head, two miles away. The first-order lens was relocated to North Head, and a fourth-order lens was installed at Cape Disappointment.

In 1937, the lighthouse was electrified. Though the Coast Guard planned to decommission the station in 1956, they retained the light after protests from the Columbia River bar pilots. The light was automated in 1973, and an observation deck was built to help the Coast Guard monitor maritime traffic and bar conditions. Today, the grounds are open to the public as part of Cape Disappointment State Park.
